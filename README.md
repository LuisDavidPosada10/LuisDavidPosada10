# 💫 About Me:
👨‍💻 **Building Bridges Between Interfaces and Logic**  
Crafting practical solutions that connect the visual with the functional. Magic happens when frontend and backend work in harmony!

🚀 **My Journey**  
From React to Node.js, with meaningful stops at MongoDB and PostgreSQL. I’ve completed my Software Development Technology degree — but the learning never stops!

🧠 **What I Believe In**  
Clean code, purpose-driven collaboration, and delivering real value line by line. Agile, DevOps, and lots of coffee are part of the process.

🌐 **Latest Projects**  
- **Incident Reporting System – Parque Alfonso López**: Full-stack system with role-based authentication and cloud deployment.  
- **Final Degree Project**: E-commerce platform built with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

🤝 **Open to Collaborations**  
Frontend with flair? Backend with brains? Fullstack adventures? Let’s talk!

✨ **Fun Fact**  
They say I’m "chill", but once I start coding — it’s game on. Nothing beats seeing an idea live in production.
